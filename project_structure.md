## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Kaolin RAT malware, a sophisticated Remote Access Trojan attributed to the North Korean Lazarus APT group. The analysis covers:

1. **Attack Chain Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of the multi-stage attack chain from initial access to final payload
2. **Technical Analysis**: In-depth analysis of each component's functionality and behavior
3. **Detection Methods**: YARA rules and IOCs for detecting the malware
4. **Evasion Techniques**: Analysis of the advanced evasion techniques used by the malware
5. **Mitigation Recommendations**: Guidance for protecting against similar threats

## How to Use This Project

### For Security Researchers

1. Review the `technical_analysis.md` file for detailed information about the malware's functionality
2. Study the `analysis_methodology.md` file to understand the techniques used to analyze the malware
3. Use the YARA rules in `yara_rules.yar` to detect similar threats in your environment

### For Security Operations Teams

1. Implement the YARA rules from `yara_rules.yar` in your security tools
2. Add the IOCs from `iocs.md` to your threat intelligence platforms
3. Review the mitigation recommendations in the README.md file

### For Publishing and Sharing

1. Use the `blog_post.md` file as a basis for publishing the analysis
2. Deploy the `index.html` file to share the analysis in a web format

## Future Work

This project could be extended in the following ways:

1. **Dynamic Analysis**: Add more detailed dynamic analysis of the malware in a controlled environment
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Provide packet captures and detailed analysis of the C2 communication
3. **Memory Forensics**: Add memory forensics analysis of the fileless components
4. **Sandbox Reports**: Include sandbox execution reports
5. **Comparison with Other Lazarus Malware**: Compare Kaolin RAT with other malware attributed to the Lazarus Group
